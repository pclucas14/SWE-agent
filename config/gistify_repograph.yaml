      <uploaded_files>
      {{working_dir}}
      </uploaded_files>
      I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory {{working_dir}}. 
      Your task is to create a **self-contained, minimal, and executable** version of the original test file when running command:\n"
      
      `{{problem_statement}}`

      This new file should:
      1. **Include all executed code paths** — it must contain **all functions, classes, and code blocks that are actually executed** when the test file is run.
      2. **Inline internal dependencies** — for any functions or classes imported from **within the same repository**, **copy their implementations directly into the new file**. 
      Do **not** use `import` statements for these internal dependencies
      3. **Exclude unnecessary code** — remove:
        * Any code (functions, variables, imports, etc.) that is **not executed** during the test run
        * Any `import` that is **unused** or only used by removed code
        * Unused `try-except` or `if-else` branches
      
      4. **Preserve existing code lines** — do not modify lines of code unless you're removing them.
      Avoid rewriting or reformatting. However, you can reformat when it requires modification such as if-else statement due to removal of certain lines.
      5. **Ensure it is executable** — the generated file should run **without errors** as a standalone script.
      6. **Do not modify the original file.** Only output the new file, called `concise.py`. The file should be saved in `{{working_dir}}`, the working directory.

      You have a new tool called `search_repo` that can help you search for functions or classes in the repository and get their definitions and references. Use this tool to understand the global information of the codebase and find the implementations of functions or classes that are used in the test file.

      Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.

          Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.

          1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script again.
            If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.
            If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.
          2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).
          3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.
            You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.py`. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to revert.
          4. Run the submit command again to confirm.

          Here is a list of all of your changes:
